  <h2>What It Does</h2>
  <p>A specialized route planning system for oversized and exceptional transport in Italy. It calculates optimal routes while considering infrastructure constraints like bridge weight limits, tunnel heights, and road width restrictions.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Problem It Solves</h2>
  <p>Companies transporting oversized cargo (wind turbines, industrial equipment, prefab buildings) need to plan routes that avoid infrastructure that can't handle their load. Currently this is done manually, which is time-consuming and error-prone. This system automates the process.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Key Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fleet Management - Register vehicles with dimensions and weight specs</li>
    <li>Route Calculation - Automatic routing with constraint checking</li>
    <li>Warning System - Alerts for bridges, tunnels, and other obstacles</li>
    <li>Quote Generation - Calculate costs and export PDF quotes</li>
    <li>GraphHopper Integration - Professional routing engine</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why I Built This</h2>
  <p>A family member works in the oversized transport industry and explained how much time they waste manually checking routes. I saw an opportunity to build a tool that could save hours of planning work and reduce the risk of encountering obstacles mid-transport.</p>
