<div class="section">
  <h2>What It Does</h2>
  <p>A visual timeline editor for arranging audio clips and visual events with precise timing. Drag clips to position them, adjust fades with handles, preview playback in real-time, and export timing code for implementation. Built specifically for designing the Band Ritual vocoder demo experience.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Problem It Solves</h2>
  <p>When building complex audio/visual experiences with narration, music, and animated elements, it's nearly impossible to describe exact timings in words. This tool lets you visually arrange everything on a timeline, hear how it sounds, see when visual elements appear, and then export the precise timing data for implementation.</p>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Key Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Multi-track Timeline</strong> - Separate tracks for vocals, synth, vocoder, visual events, and transitions</li>
    <li><strong>Waveform Display</strong> - See audio waveforms extracted from actual files</li>
    <li><strong>Draggable Clips</strong> - Move and resize audio events by dragging</li>
    <li><strong>Fade Handles</strong> - Drag cyan dots to adjust fade in/out times visually</li>
    <li><strong>Real-time Preview</strong> - Play timeline with actual audio and see playhead position</li>
    <li><strong>Visual Preview Panel</strong> - See VOICE/SYNTH boxes animate as they would in the final experience</li>
    <li><strong>Morph Indicator</strong> - Shows DRY to WET morph progress percentage</li>
    <li><strong>Undo/Redo</strong> - Cmd+Z / Cmd+Shift+Z with 20-step history</li>
    <li><strong>Marquee Selection</strong> - Select multiple clips with rectangle drag</li>
    <li><strong>Drag & Drop Audio</strong> - Add new audio files by dropping onto tracks</li>
    <li><strong>Export Timing Code</strong> - Copy structured timing data for Claude to implement</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why I Built This</h2>
  <p>I was building a vocoder demo experience for the Band Ritual website with 4 vocal narration clips, synth audio, animated boxes, and a dry-to-wet morph transition. Trying to describe exact timings ("the synth should fade in 0.96 seconds starting at 8.80s") was tedious and error-prone. This tool lets me visually arrange everything, hear it play back, and export the exact timings for implementation.</p>
