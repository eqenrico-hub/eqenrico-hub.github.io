  <h2>What It Does</h2>
  <p>LAYERS is a VST3/AU multi-sample instrument plugin by Ritual Audio Labs. Users stack audio samples as colored visual layers, draw a target output curve, and the engine automatically mixes them to match that curve using a dual-priority system: layer priority (volume/headroom order) and frequency priority (spectral ownership).</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Problem It Solves</h2>
  <p>Multi-sample mixing has always been chaos — layers competing for headroom, frequencies clashing, and no structure to the combined output. Traditional sample layering requires manual volume automation, EQ carving, and constant A/B testing. LAYERS solves this by letting producers draw the desired output shape and having the engine intelligently distribute each sample's contribution.</p>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Key Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Layer Stack:</strong> Drag and drop up to 5 audio samples as colored visual layers with 3D perspective view</li>
    <li><strong>Output Curve:</strong> Draw a golden target amplitude envelope — the combined output matches this shape exactly</li>
    <li><strong>Priority Mix:</strong> Highest priority layer plays naturally, lower layers complement to fill the curve</li>
    <li><strong>Frequency Zones:</strong> Each layer owns a frequency band (bass, lows, mids, highs, air) for spectral clarity</li>
    <li><strong>Layer Editor:</strong> Ableton-style clip editor with waveform, warp markers, pitch, loop points, and per-layer EQ</li>
    <li><strong>Per-Layer EQ:</strong> Parametric EQ with spectrogram visualization and draggable nodes</li>
    <li><strong>Match Gauge:</strong> Real-time percentage showing how closely output follows the target curve</li>
    <li><strong>Contribution Meters:</strong> Per-layer horizontal bars showing each layer's contribution to the mix</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why I Built This</h2>
  <p>As a producer, layering samples is fundamental but the mixing process is tedious — constantly adjusting volumes, carving EQ, and hoping the layers complement each other. LAYERS flips the workflow: instead of tweaking individual layers to hope for a good output, you define the output you want and let the engine figure out how each layer contributes. The priority system ensures your most important layer (e.g., a kick's low-end) never gets compromised.</p>
