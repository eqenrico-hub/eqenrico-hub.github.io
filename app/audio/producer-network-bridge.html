<div class="section">
  <h2>What It Does</h2>
  <p>A platform where music producers sign up through a beautiful 7-step onboarding flow and get matched with similar producers based on genre, favorite artists, production style, and career stage. Think "Tinder for producer collaborations" with a sophisticated multi-factor matching algorithm.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Problem It Solves</h2>
  <p>Finding collaborators in music production is hard. Producers often work in isolation without knowing other artists who share their sound, genre, or creative vision. This platform uses intelligent matching based on real SoundCloud network connections to connect producers who would actually vibe together.</p>

  <h2>Why I Built This</h2>
  <p>The music production world is surprisingly isolated despite the internet connecting everyone. Producers often work alone, not knowing other artists who share their exact vibe. I wanted to create a platform that uses the real connections on SoundCloud (who follows who) combined with musical preferences to make genuinely useful matches - not just random suggestions, but producers you'd actually want to collaborate with.</p>
