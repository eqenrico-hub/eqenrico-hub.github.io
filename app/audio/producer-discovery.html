  <h2>Problem It Solves</h2>
  <p>Finding emerging color bass, future riddim, and experimental bass producers is tedious. Forums are outdated, playlists favor big names, and manual searching takes forever. This tool automates discovery by mining who your favorite producers follow, revealing underground artists you'd never find manually.</p>

  <h2>Why I Built This</h2>
  <p>I wanted to discover underground color bass and future riddim producers but got tired of manually digging through forums and playlists. The best way to find new artists is through who your favorite producers follow - they're all connected. This tool automates that discovery process and has already found me 100+ producers I'd never heard of.</p>
