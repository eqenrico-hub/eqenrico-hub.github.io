The parable of NFTs, seen today, brings a bitter smile: an idea that promised revolutions (even noble ones) and instead, in practice, deflated leaving behind mostly noise. Yet, to be completely honest, the interesting point isn't just that "it was hype" or that "there was money laundering," but that it was also a real cultural experiment: a large-scale test of a very seductive thesis—the democratization of art through technology.

The initial argument sounded almost unassailable: if I can certify ownership and provenance in a decentralized way, if I can sell without galleries, without intermediaries, without curators, then art finally becomes direct. The artist meets the public, the market "opens up," hierarchies collapse.

But something different happened: the intermediaries didn't disappear, they changed. The power to legitimize didn't vanish, it shifted. First there were galleries and institutions; then came influencers, platforms, communities, "whales," algorithms, social dynamics. In other words: mediation wasn't eliminated, it just changed its face.

And here, I believe, lies the deepest lesson: perhaps the idea of truly "disintermediated" art is a misunderstanding of what art actually is in its social functioning. Because art isn't just an object or a file; it's a field of relationships, contexts, gazes. Artistic value isn't pure data that emerges as soon as you remove the gatekeepers. Value also arises from how a work is seen, narrated, staged, discussed, compared. It's an aesthetic fact, yes, but the aesthetic doesn't exist in a vacuum: it always lives within an environment of interpretations.

And here a certain synthesis comes to mind: "how morality is also aesthetic." That is: we never judge only "the thing," we also judge the form of its appearance, the posture with which it presents itself, the frame that makes it legible. Even when we think we're making a moral argument ("this is authentic," "this is right," "this is worthy"), we're actually using criteria that are also aesthetic: recognizability, coherence, intensity, style, persuasion. The reverse is equally true: aesthetics always carries with it a dimension of norm, of choice, of "should." Therefore, mediation isn't a parasite on art: it's part of aesthetics itself, because it's part of how a work exists for others.

NFTs showed, almost didactically, that the promise of democratization runs aground precisely there: you can open technical access, but you can't eliminate the need for frames and filters. You can make buying and selling easier, but you can't make "horizontal" what by nature tends to organize itself around unequal attention. Because attention is scarce, and where attention is scarce, a system of selection will always emerge: someone (or something) will say what's worth looking at. And that "saying" is already mediation.

In the end, then, the disappointment isn't just economic ("who lost money") but conceptual: we've seen that technology alone isn't enough to democratize a phenomenon that is structurally social, symbolic, hierarchical. And perhaps this isn't even a tragedy: it simply means that art isn't a pure market nor a pure file; it's a game of gazes, authority, trust, narratives. The intermediary isn't just an obstacle: it's also one of the places where meaning is constructed.

So, if I must salvage something from that shipwreck, it's precisely this: not so much "NFTs were a scam" (which is a shortcut), but "NFTs were a dress rehearsal" that made a broader truth visible. Art, as long as it remains human art, cannot be fully democratized in the naive sense of the term, because it cannot be completely freed from mediation. Not because there's always someone "cheating," but because art, the moment it becomes shared experience, lives through mediations: and those mediations are already part of its aesthetics, its way of existing.
