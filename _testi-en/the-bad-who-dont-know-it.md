There are bad people in the world. Not the spectacular villains from movies, but the real ones, the everyday ones, blending into the crowd. They're all around us. Sometimes they smile at us. Sometimes we've known them forever. Sometimes we've been them.

And the most unsettling fact is that they often don't even know they are.

They don't wake up in the morning intending to cause harm. They don't plan suffering. They act, speak, choose… with a strange certainty, as if their perspective were the only possible one. The problem isn't malice. The problem is the wrong map they use to read the world.

And this becomes clear from one detail: they can't imagine themselves on the other side. They can't put themselves in the shoes of those who suffer, who are excluded, who live on the other end of their actions. Not out of malice, but because they've forgotten how. Or they never got there in the first place. And above all, they don't listen. They don't truly listen. They only listen to respond, never to understand. They hear others' words as background noise, something to manage or reject, not to welcome. And this pins them in place, makes their conscience impermeable.

This is exactly what Hannah Arendt described as the banality of evil: not conscious monsters, but ordinary people, obtuse, incapable of critical thought. They don't do evil because they want to destroy: they do it because they don't think, and they don't want to see.

A similar case can be seen in Breaking Bad, where Walter White starts out driven by rational, almost noble motivations. But along the way, he justifies every step, every harm, every act of violence — convinced he's always right, while destroying everything and everyone. His is a progressive moral blindness disguised as logic.

And this is the clearest sign that the vision is distorted. Because if we assume they're not evil (and truly, in most cases they're not), then the reason they cause harm is simple: they don't know what it means to be the other. They have a limited imagination for others' suffering. A weak conception of what it means to be on the wrong side of power, privilege, opinion. And so their idea of "right" is, at its core, fragile.

The series The Good Place plays exactly with this: it shows a failed moral system, where good intentions aren't enough and where people find themselves punished or exalted not for who they are, but for what they failed to understand. The central point is clear: you cannot be good if you're incapable of seeing the other.

Here the distinction is born: between those who don't know, and those who don't want to know. Between simple ignorance and the kind that becomes evil through omission, laziness, fear of confrontation. And yet, even they are creatures of context. They're the product of a world that never taught them to see beyond themselves.

And this is where everything changes. Not because they become less dangerous — they often remain so — but because they become more readable. When you understand that certain people aren't "choosing evil," but are simply acting within a flawed logic, you can stop attributing to them an intentionality they don't have.

You don't have to excuse them. But you're not obligated to fight them as if they were lucidly malevolent either. You can simply consider them system errors, side effects of a culture that stopped teaching critical thinking and empathy as real tools. They shouldn't be taken seriously. Or at least: no more seriously than we'd take a dog barking at a mirror, convinced it's an enemy.

And at that point, the problem is no longer theirs. It's ours: deciding how much time and energy is worth throwing at someone who doesn't even have the means to understand the damage they cause.
