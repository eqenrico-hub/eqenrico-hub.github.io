In the previous text, we arrived at a conclusion: distraction is our survival mechanism. Zapffe was right — we are animals that know too much, and to keep from going mad, we distract ourselves.

But there is a question that comes before resignation.

Before concluding that consciousness is an evolutionary error — before embracing antinatalism as the only logical response — let's give ourselves the space to ask: why did we develop this way?

## The equilibrium that doesn't get it wrong

Evolution has no plan. It has no goals, no intentions. But it has a rule it never violates: what doesn't work, over time, disappears.

Species that persist — those that are not going extinct now or anytime soon — tend toward equilibrium. Traits that are net negatives get selected against over millions of years. A trait that makes life unlivable doesn't expand: it goes extinct.

Yet consciousness expanded. The human brain grew for millions of years. The prefrontal cortex — the seat of self-awareness, planning, existential anxiety — developed and refined itself, generation after generation.

If consciousness were only a burden, an error, a weight with no compensation, evolution would have eliminated it. It didn't. It amplified it.

And that tells us something.

## The trade-off

It tells us that consciousness is not an error. It's a trade-off.

An evolutionary trade-off works like this: a trait carries a cost, but also a benefit that exceeds it. If the benefit outweighs the cost in terms of survival and reproduction, the trait gets selected. Even if it hurts.

Consciousness carries an enormous cost: we know we must die. This knowledge generates anxiety, anguish, paralysis — everything Zapffe described. But it also brings benefits that no other trait in the history of life has ever produced.

The question, then, is not: why do we suffer?

The question is: does the price we pay justify what we've gained?

## What consciousness unlocked

Think about what awareness made possible.

Society. Not the pack, not the herd — society. A system of shared rules, built on the ability to imagine another's point of view. Animals live in groups. Humans live in civilizations.

Empathy. Not the simple affiliation of the pack, but the ability to suffer for a stranger. To decide to help someone who doesn't share your genes, your territory, your species. No animal has ever built a hospital for strangers. We do it every day.

Medicine. An animal born with a deformity is condemned. An insect with a broken wing dies. A lame deer gets taken by wolves. But a human being born deaf, blind, missing a limb, with a genetic disease — can live a full life. Not because nature allows it, but because consciousness produced medicine, surgery, prosthetics, rehabilitation. It produced people willing to dedicate their lives to healing strangers.

Culture. Art, music, philosophy, romantic love, deep friendship — everything that makes life not just bearable but meaningful. None of this exists without consciousness.

Justice. In nature, the strongest wins. Always. Without exception. In human society, we invented the concept of rights — the idea that even the weakest deserve protection. Imperfect, certainly. Constantly violated, certainly. But it exists. And in nature, it doesn't. And without consciousness, it couldn't even be conceived.

## The reality of animal life

Now think about animals. Not the ones from documentaries — the majestic lions, the singing whales, the playful dolphins. Think about the statistical reality of animal life. Think about what it means to be any animal at all, chosen at random from all those currently living on Earth.

An insect. Born, lives for days or weeks, dies. Probably eaten, crushed, or simply spent. Without ever knowing it existed. Without ever experiencing — as far as we know — anything resembling an experience.

A fish. Most fish die within days of hatching. Out of thousands of eggs, one or two individuals survive. The rest are eaten before they even develop a mature nervous system.

A rodent. Lives one or two years, in constant alertness for predators. If it gets sick, it dies. If it gets injured, it dies. If it finds contaminated food, it dies. No doctor, no hospital, no organized compassion.

Even in the most complex social species — monkeys, for example — an injured or deformed individual is often isolated, discriminated against, abandoned by the group. Not out of malice: out of biology. Nature doesn't know empathy in the human sense. Empathy — real empathy, the kind that extends beyond your own group, beyond your own species — is a product of consciousness.

And then there are our domestic animals. The best possible case for an animal. A dog, loved, fed, protected, cared for. Living a carefree existence, without demands, without existential anxiety, without the weight of knowing it will end. Yet even this dog, in its relationships with other dogs, remains in biology. It cannot access culture, values, meaning. It cannot decide to be better than what its instinct dictates. If another dog is injured or weak, the reaction isn't necessarily compassion — it can be aggression, forced submission, exclusion. The pack follows rules that no dog chose and no dog can change.

## "I wish I were an animal"

So let's actually ask ourselves: when we say "I wish I were as carefree as an animal," does it make sense?

When we say it, we're imagining being a cat curled up on a couch. A golden retriever running through a meadow. A dolphin jumping in the ocean.

We're not imagining being a mosquito that lives three weeks. Or a goldfish in a pond, eaten by a heron on day two. Or a field mouse, paralyzed with terror every time a shadow passes overhead.

We're comparing the best case of animal life with the worst burden of human consciousness.

But reality doesn't offer us this choice. We can't choose to be a golden retriever. If we could choose to be born as any animal, the probability of ending up as an insect, a worm, a freshly hatched fish — an organism that lives for days, suffers, and dies without ever knowing why — would be overwhelming.

And here the reasoning stops being philosophy and becomes calculation.

## The calculation

Imagine finding yourself before birth, facing a choice. You don't know where you'll be born, or how, or when. You know nothing. You have only two options:

**Option A**: you're born as any random animal on Earth.
**Option B**: you're born as any random human on Earth.

To decide rationally, we need to calculate the expected value of each option — the sum of all possible scenarios, each weighted by its probability and the quality of experience it entails.

Let's define a Quality of Existence Index (QEI), on a scale from -1 (worst conceivable existence) to +1 (best), where 0 is neutral.

### Option A: born as any random animal

The expected value of the animal QEI is:

**E[QEI_animal] = sum of P(species) x QEI(species)**

Where P(species) is the probability of being born as an individual of that species, proportional to the number of living individuals.

Here's the distribution, based on scientific estimates of biomass and individual counts:

| Category | % of animal individuals | Average lifespan | Main risks | Estimated QEI |
|----------|------------------------|-----------------|------------|---------------|
| Insects and invertebrates | ~80% | Days to weeks | Immediate predation, no support, minimal or no consciousness | -0.20 |
| Fish | ~15% | Most die within days | Enormous larval mortality, constant predation | -0.10 |
| Birds | ~4% | 2-5 years | Predation, climate, no medicine | 0.00 |
| Common mammals | ~1% | 1-15 years | Predation, disease, starvation, untreated injuries | +0.10 |
| "Privileged" mammals (great apes, dolphins, elephants) | ~0.001% | 30-70 years | Less predation, complex sociality, rudimentary empathy | +0.20 |

**E[QEI_animal] = (0.80 x -0.20) + (0.15 x -0.10) + (0.04 x 0.00) + (0.01 x 0.10) + (0.00001 x 0.20)**

**E[QEI_animal] = -0.160 + (-0.015) + 0.000 + 0.001 + 0.000002**

**E[QEI_animal] ≈ -0.17**

The expected value is negative. If you could be born as any animal, your average experience would be worse than not existing at all.

### Option B: born as any random human

**E[QEI_human] = sum of P(condition) x QEI(condition) - k**

Where k is the "Zapffe cost" — the existential weight of consciousness.

Human conditions, with their approximate probabilities:

| Condition | % of population | Factors | Estimated QEI |
|-----------|----------------|---------|---------------|
| Good life | ~50% | Decent health, relationships, access to education and healthcare, ability to find meaning | +0.60 |
| Moderate difficulties | ~30% | Moderate poverty, treatable health issues, limited but present access to services, community | +0.20 |
| Significant suffering with moments of joy | ~15% | Extreme poverty, severe disability, conflict, but also family bonds, moments of beauty, hope | -0.10 |
| Extreme suffering | ~5% | Famine, active war, terminal illness without care, severe abuse, total isolation | -0.50 |

**E[QEI_human_base] = (0.50 x 0.60) + (0.30 x 0.20) + (0.15 x -0.10) + (0.05 x -0.50)**

**E[QEI_human_base] = 0.300 + 0.060 + (-0.015) + (-0.025)**

**E[QEI_human_base] = +0.32**

Now we subtract the Zapffe cost. How much does the awareness of death, existential anxiety, and moral suffering that comes from knowing actually weigh?

It's a difficult estimate, but we can be generous with pessimism:

**k ≈ 0.10**

This means consciousness reduces quality of life by 10% of the entire scale — a significant cost, equivalent to saying that existential anguish weighs as much as the difference between a good life and a life with moderate difficulties.

**E[QEI_human] = 0.32 - 0.10 = +0.22**

### The result

| Option | Expected value (QEI) |
|--------|---------------------|
| Random animal | **-0.17** |
| Random human | **+0.22** |

Difference: **0.39 points** on a 2-point scale.

Being born as a human, even including the full weight of consciousness, has an expected value 0.39 points higher than being born as any random animal. Not by a little. By a lot.

### How heavy would consciousness need to be to flip the result?

To make the human option equivalent to the animal one, the cost of consciousness would need to be:

**k_critical = E[QEI_human_base] - E[QEI_animal] = 0.32 - (-0.17) = 0.49**

That is, consciousness would need to make life nearly half a scale worse — it would need to be more destructive than predation, starvation, premature death, the total absence of medicine and society, and the life of an insect that lasts three days. All combined.

For those who find pessimism more convincing than optimism, let's double the cost:

**E[QEI_human_pessimist] = 0.32 - 0.20 = +0.12**

Still positive. Still better than -0.17.

To truly flip the result would require assumptions that, in effect, deny all value to everything consciousness has produced — medicine, empathy, justice, art, love, the ability to overcome what nature imposes. Assumptions that no one, not even the most committed antinatalist, truly holds to the end. Because fully maintaining that consciousness is worth nothing would mean that nothing — not even one's own argument against consciousness — has value. And that's a contradiction that eats itself.

## What this all means

It doesn't mean suffering doesn't exist. It doesn't mean Zapffe was wrong — the weight of consciousness is real, and anyone who denies it hasn't understood the question.

It means that weight is the price of something. And that something is worth enormously more than the price.

When we say "I wish I were an animal," we're not making a calculation. We're making an emotional comparison between our worst moment and the most serene image we can imagine. But the serenity of a cat on a couch isn't available to most animals. It's accessible only because a conscious human being decided to take care of that cat.

Consciousness is not an evolutionary error. It's the best deal evolution ever made. It has a cost — Zapffe was right about that. Knowing you must die is a weight no other animal carries. But that weight is the price of everything else: society, medicine, empathy, culture, meaning, the possibility of building a world where even those born disadvantaged can live.

And so, returning to the original question: if we had been asked before being born — not knowing where, or how, or when — whether we wanted to be a carefree animal or a conscious human, the calculation says one thing only.

We are fortunate.

Not out of ignorance of what we lose. But for the full measure of what we gain.
