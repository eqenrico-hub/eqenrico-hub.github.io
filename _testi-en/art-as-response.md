We were born into a world that has no intrinsic meaning. No one hands us a script, no predefined purpose. And yet, we feel—deeply. We experience joy, pain, nostalgia, fear, beauty. We want to be understood. We want to matter.

In that tension—between a silent universe and an emergent consciousness that never stops asking "why"—something begins to stir.

That is where the need to create is born. It isn't just a hobby or a profession. It's a response. A rebellion. A way of declaring: I am here. I felt this.

It's an attempt to carve meaning into chaos, to give shape to something that can't stay trapped inside forever—molding it into something that might outlive us. Not to leave a legacy, not to be remembered or admired, but simply to leave behind a fragment of presence. A trace that says: this existed. I existed.

Even if no one looks. Even if no one ever will.

And why do we do it through what we call art? Because—what else is there?

Art is the only act in which we can create something that didn't exist before, something that has no intrinsic utility, no fixed meaning—and that's precisely why it works. It mirrors the absurdity of being alive.

Once you truly understand that nothing around us has objective meaning, a fundamental question remains: Why do anything at all? Why dedicate your life to something that shares that same void?

And yet, that awareness doesn't paralyze us—it sets us free.

If the world is devoid of meaning, then we are free to invent. Free to pour our attention, our time, ourselves into something that exists outside of necessity.

That's where art becomes a sacred gesture: not because it serves a purpose, but precisely because it doesn't.

We create it, we give it meaning, or we leave it open, free for others to find their own. Even when art declares itself meaningless, it reinforces this very argument. That kind of art is the most radical, the most coherent expression of this truth: if nothing has meaning, then creating something without meaning is the purest form of devotion.

And in doing so, it reflects with brutal honesty the artist's cry: Don't do anything meaningful, because nothing has meaning. And yet—do it anyway.

Art for art's sake. It's not a matter of luxury or detachment. It's a matter of coherence. When nothing has meaning except what we give it, then creating something simply because we feel the need to do it is the most sincere act we can commit to.

It's not a strategy. It's not a solution. It's a scream that can take any shape imaginable.

And yet, no work is ever truly finished. There's always a line to rewrite, a tone to adjust, a version that could say it better. This is the unbearable truth behind the words: "Art is never finished, only abandoned." Leonardo da Vinci said it first, and every artist since has felt its weight.

In the story of Zima Blue, an episode of the animated anthology series Love, Death & Robots, a machine—once given a human-like body—strips away every layer of constructed identity. It renounces not only fame, knowledge, and artistic mastery, but also its physical form, returning to a minimal, utilitarian body built solely for function.

It returns to the simplest act of creation: cleaning and painting small blue tiles on the edge of a pool—a task it was programmed for before becoming sentient. That gesture, once mechanical and overlooked, becomes sacred. That's where it all began, and that's where it finally understands itself.

Zima no longer seeks greatness—it seeks truth. And that truth lies not in the grand gesture, but in humble repetition, in the pure need to make. It's what remains when every artifice has been stripped away.

This need isn't rational. It's existential.

It's the scream behind Lucio Battisti's "Vedi caro amico," a song that feels less like a melody and more like a desperate plea. "You see, dear friend, what one must invent / Just to laugh it off / Just to keep on hoping."

What must we invent, what must we create, just to keep on hoping?

In those words lies a supplication—to be seen, to be met halfway by someone who understands. And when he sings "And if this year just flew by in an instant," he's not just talking about time slipping away—he's talking about the terror of remaining invisible, about the need to exist.

"That in this moment, I too may be here."

That I may be here, now, in this shared instant.

Art is born precisely in that fragile space. Not from certainty, but from longing. From the will not to vanish in silence. From the impossibility of fully explaining what we have inside, and from the relentless need to try anyway.

To make art is to declare: I am here. I felt this. Please, look at me.

And sometimes, someone does.
