What is humanity's greatest question? Not the meaning of life. Not happiness. Not God.

Death.

It is the only universal problem—non-negotiable, unavoidable. Everything else—politics, culture, progress, economics—is subordinate to this elemental fact: every human being is born knowing, however vaguely, that they will die.

And so the question becomes inevitable: why has humanity never organized itself around this single problem? Why haven't we dedicated the entire history of civilization to figuring out how not to die?

The answer isn't obvious, and any explanation risks sounding reductive. But there is a pattern that keeps emerging, every time we try to look at the question without consolation.

Not a fault. Not a moral failing.

A silent, structural choice.

Each of us knows we are unlikely to see a solution within the span of a single lifetime. This knowledge changes everything.

It doesn't make the pursuit of immortality absurd. It makes it poorly incentivized: the cost is in the present, the benefit—if it ever arrives—is often beyond the life of whoever bears that cost. The sacrifice is certain, the result remote, and almost never for the one who pays for it.

Better, then, to live now than to work for a future that won't include us. Not out of malice, but because of temporal asymmetry.

This is where a private kind of anger is born, one that's hard to name. Not from a lack of will, but from the disproportion between what we could do and what we would ever get to see.

How many human beings could have given meaning to their own mortality by making others immortal? It would have been something to belong to the "chosen" generation—the one that unlocks immortality as a stage of civilization's evolution. But that's not how it went.

And yet this explanation still isn't enough. Because it's not true that we haven't tried.

There are figures who have dedicated their entire existence to studying immortality, pursuing it with method, obsession, discipline. In Naples, in the eighteenth century, Raimondo di Sangro spent his life between alchemy, anatomy, and experiments on body and matter, in an attempt to force that final limit.

He wasn't distracted. He wasn't resigned. He wasn't indifferent.

And yet he died.

The problem, then, isn't that we haven't searched. It's that even when we truly search, the outcome doesn't change.

And here the central knot emerges.

We don't avoid death because we don't care about it. We avoid it because it paralyzes us.

Death is the only problem that, as things stand, we cannot solve. And speaking about what cannot be solved produces an unbearable friction: knowing without being able to act. So we adopt the most functional strategy available: distraction.

Not because we are unaware. But because being fully aware, with no way out, would be unlivable.

In this sense, living without thinking about death isn't superficiality. It's a form of adaptive intelligence. Laughing, working, loving, knitting, watching a show, building something—none of this is escape. It is a silent scream. A way of saying: I know where I'm headed, but I choose not to stare into the void.

And here, distraction stops being a fault and becomes structure.

The Norwegian philosopher Peter Wessel Zapffe saw this with brutal clarity: the human being is an animal that knows too much. It knows it must die, but lacks the means to prevent that end. This disproportion between consciousness and possibility makes life, if taken to its fullest, almost unmanageable.

That's why—he said—we don't live in continuous truth of our condition, but interrupt it. With work, with love, with art, with entertainment. Not out of ignorance, but out of necessity. Distraction isn't an individual weakness: it's a collective survival technique.

In this sense, living without constantly thinking about death isn't superficiality. It's the most lucidity we can afford. It's the silent compromise between what we know and what we can bear. Not because the void doesn't exist, but because staring at it without being able to fill it would make us incapable of living.

And so we go on: selfish, perhaps. Distracted, certainly. But not for lack of depth. For an excess of consciousness.
