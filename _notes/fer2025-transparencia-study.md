## Overview

This project, funded through ULB's **Fonds d'Encouragement a la Recherche (FER 2025)** with a total budget of **EUR 57,068**, is a complementary but distinct study from TRANSACT. While TRANSACT focuses on email-mediated field experiments, this project examines **platform-mediated FOI requests** through the analysis of approximately **100,000 documents** submitted via **Transparencia.be** between 2014 and 2024.

**Principal Investigator:** Prof. Giovanni Esposito, CEPAP, ULB

**Core Research Question:** How do public bureaucrats discriminate among platform-mediated FOI requests in Belgium?

## Context

Transparencia.be is an **open-source platform** run by volunteers in Belgium that allows citizens to submit and track their FOI requests to public institutions. It represents one of the largest repositories of real-world FOI interactions in Europe.

While existing FOI field experiments have examined email-based requests, only one study (Trautendorfer et al., 2024, in Germany) has examined FOI requests mediated by digital platforms. This project fills that gap for Belgium by analyzing real citizen interactions rather than controlled experimental submissions.

## Methodology

The study employs a **labour-intensive empirical approach**:

1. **Data Collection**: Four research assistants (jobistes) will be hired for 5 months, each working 40 hours/week to process and code the dataset
2. **AI-Assisted Coding**: Research assistants will be trained to use AI tools to extract data on request topics, tone, status (resolved, ignored, refused), and other relevant variables
3. **Processing Rate**: Approximately 250 documents collectively per day (~63 per researcher), enabled by AI assistance
4. **Variables Extracted**: Request topic, tone, status/outcome, administrative level, temporal patterns

## Two Planned Publications

**Paper 1**: How the **topic and tone** of FOI requests affect platform-mediated information disclosure. Examines whether certain types of requests (e.g., high-accountability topics like government spending vs. low-accountability topics like individual needs) receive different treatment on digital platforms.

**Paper 2**: Uses **"if-and-if" methodologies** for policy evaluation to assess whether the entry into force of FOI-related regulatory provisions at different points in time since 2014 has improved the platform's effectiveness in mediating information disclosure.

## Relationship to TRANSACT

This FER project takes a **complementary but distinct approach** from the TRANSACT ERC proposal:

- **TRANSACT (ERC)**: Uses controlled randomized field experiments with email-mediated FOI requests across 4 countries
- **FER 2025**: Uses document analysis of real citizen interactions on a digital platform in Belgium

Both projects investigate the implementation of FOI laws mediated by ICTs, but using different methodologies and perspectives. The ERC project focuses on experimental designs to explore discretion in email-mediated requests, while the FER proposal leverages large-scale document analysis to understand platform-mediated discretion.
