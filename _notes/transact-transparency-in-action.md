## What is TRANSACT?

TRANSACT (Transparency in Action) is a research project developed at the Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB) that uses field experiments to measure the gap between formal adoption of Freedom of Information (FOI) laws and their actual implementation in practice. The project applies citizen science methodologies to generate empirical evidence on how public administrations respond to information requests.

The core research question of TRANSACT is: once transparency laws are formally adopted, are they actually implemented? And if so, under what conditions? The project moves beyond theoretical analysis of legal frameworks to measure real-world administrative behavior through systematic experimental protocols.

## Field Experiment Methodology

The TRANSACT methodology consists of systematically submitting FOI requests to public administrations following a controlled experimental protocol. By varying specific parameters (requester profile, mention of legal framework, type of information requested) while keeping others constant, researchers can measure which factors affect administrative responsiveness.

### The Belgian Experiment

The flagship TRANSACT experiment was conducted across all 581 municipal administrations in Belgium. Requests were sent using five different requester profiles:

- **Common citizen**: A standard citizen requesting information without any special status
- **Citizen mentioning FOI law**: Same request but explicitly citing the legal right of access
- **University professor**: Academic affiliation visible in the request
- **University professor mentioning FOI law**: Academic status combined with legal citation
- **Civil society organisation**: Request sent on behalf of an advocacy group

All profiles requested the same information (a simple administrative document), allowing researchers to isolate the effect of requester identity and legal framing on response rates.

### Response Categories

Responses were systematically coded across five categories:

- **No reply**: Administration did not respond within the legal timeframe
- **Denial**: Explicit refusal to provide the information
- **Unsatisfactory reply**: Response received but not addressing the request
- **Partial reply**: Some information provided but incomplete
- **Complete reply**: Full disclosure of requested information

## Key Findings

The Belgian experiment produced several significant findings about FOI implementation:

### Regional and Institutional Factors

Response rates varied significantly across regions and institutional contexts. Larger municipalities demonstrated higher responsiveness, likely due to greater administrative capacity and dedicated staff for handling information requests. Certain regions showed systematically better performance, reflecting differences in administrative culture and prioritisation of transparency.

### The Expertise Paradox

Counter-intuitively, requesters perceived as more knowledgeable about FOI rights (academics, civil society actors, those citing the law) faced greater resistance from administrations. This suggests risk-averse administrative behavior: officials may be more cautious when they perceive the requester as potentially more likely to challenge a refusal or publicise problematic responses.

### The Demand Side of Transparency

Citizen persistence and engagement positively influenced response rates. This highlights that transparency policy cannot rely solely on supply-side measures (legal frameworks, institutional obligations) but must also consider how to empower and support citizens in exercising their rights effectively.

### Implementation Gap

The experiments documented a substantial gap between formal law adoption and practical implementation. This gap varies significantly across jurisdictions and administrative contexts, demonstrating that legal guarantees alone do not ensure effective access to information.

## Citizen Science Approach

A distinctive feature of TRANSACT is its use of citizen science methodologies. Non-professional researchers (students, civil society members, engaged citizens) participate in the design and implementation of the experiments. This approach serves multiple purposes:

- Generates robust empirical data through distributed data collection
- Builds civic capacity and engagement with transparency issues among participants
- Creates a community of practice around FOI monitoring
- Ensures research findings are grounded in practical experience
- Democratises the research process itself

The citizen science framework transforms FOI research from a purely academic exercise into a participatory process that itself contributes to democratic capacity building.

## International Expansion

Following the success of the Belgian experiment, TRANSACT methodology is being extended to other countries with different governance contexts and transparency regimes:

- **Switzerland**: Testing FOI implementation across cantonal and municipal levels in a federal system
- **Romania**: Examining transparency practices in a post-transition European context
- **South Africa**: Applying the methodology in a Global South context with different administrative traditions

This international expansion allows for comparative analysis of FOI implementation across different legal frameworks, administrative cultures, and governance traditions.
