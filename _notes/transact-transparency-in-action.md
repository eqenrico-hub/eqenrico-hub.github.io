## What is TRANSACT?

TRANSACT (**Trans**parency in **Act**ion) is a major research project led by Prof. Giovanni Esposito at the Universite libre de Bruxelles (ULB), submitted as an **ERC Starting Grant 2025** proposal with a budget of **EUR 1,499,994** over **60 months** (5 years). The project uses field experiments to measure the gap between formal adoption of Freedom of Information (FOI) laws and their actual implementation in practice.

The core research question: **Why do FOI laws, despite widespread formal adoption, fail in practice to deliver on their promise of transparency?**

TRANSACT develops a novel **practice-based model** of FOI implementation, integrating insights from three existing research traditions (rationalist, critical, and organizational) into a more comprehensive conceptual framework. It moves beyond theoretical analysis to examine the practical realities faced by citizens seeking government-held information.

## Theoretical Innovation

TRANSACT rejects the oversimplified, siloed views of existing FOI research:

- **Rationalist tradition**: Assumes legislation alone guarantees transparency (input-output model)
- **Critical tradition**: Views FOI laws as "decoys" by elites to create an illusion of transparency (power-based model)
- **Organizational tradition**: Attributes FOI failures solely to individual bureaucratic self-interest (process-based model)

Instead, TRANSACT adopts an **interdisciplinary perspective**, hypothesizing that FOI effectiveness depends on the complex interplay of three factors:

1. **Bureaucrats' FOI Practices**: How officials exercise discretion in deciding whether to disclose or withhold information
2. **Citizens' FOI Requests**: How the nature and presentation of requests influence bureaucratic behavior
3. **Societal Context**: How broader socio-political and economic conditions affect transparency outcomes

## The Practice-Based Model

TRANSACT's central hypothesis posits that FOI laws fail because of (1) the varied practices of bureaucrats who can choose to disclose or withhold, and (2) these practices being shaped by interactions with citizens and societal contexts. The formal model:

> B(0,1,2,3,4) = f(I(a,b,c,d,e), C)

Where **B** represents bureaucratic disclosure practices (from no response to full disclosure), **I** represents independent variables (requester identity, gender, topic, tone, legal framing), and **C** represents contextual factors (socio-economic conditions).

## Cross-Country Field Experiment

TRANSACT conducts a **randomized field experiment across 4 countries**: Romania (Eastern Europe), Uganda (Africa), Japan (Asia), and Canada (North America). This addresses a major gap since most FOI experiments have focused on the US, Latin America, and Western Europe, with none in Africa or Asia.

**Experimental design:**
- **6 requester identities** (common citizen, lawyer, university researcher, civil society activist, journalist) x 2 genders = 12 profiles
- **2 topic sensitivities** (sensitive vs. non-sensitive) x 2 tones (formal vs. informal) x 2 FOI norm mentions (included/excluded)
- **48 unique treatments per country**, minimum 200 trials each
- **Total: 9,600 trials across four countries**

Each municipality is randomly assigned a treatment, stratified by population size. Responses are coded into 5 categories: no response (B0), malicious refusal (B1), adversarial refusal (B2), partial disclosure (B3), and full disclosure (B4).

## The Belgian Pilot Experiment

The flagship pilot was conducted across **all 581 municipal administrations in Belgium**, involving 45 students from Esposito's masterclass at ULB acting as **citizen scientists** in collaboration with **Transparencia.be**, a Belgian advocacy organization.

Five requester profiles were tested:
- Common citizen
- Citizen mentioning FOI law
- University professor
- University professor mentioning FOI law
- Civil society organisation

### Key Findings

**The Expertise Paradox**: Counter-intuitively, requesters perceived as more knowledgeable about FOI rights faced greater resistance. This suggests risk-averse bureaucratic behavior rather than genuine engagement with transparency obligations.

**Regional Disparities**: Response rates varied significantly across regions and institutional contexts, reflecting differences in administrative culture and capacity.

**The Demand Side**: Citizen persistence positively influenced response rates, highlighting that transparency cannot rely solely on legal frameworks but must empower citizens.

**Implementation Gap**: A substantial gap between formal law adoption and practical implementation, varying significantly across jurisdictions.

## Project Structure (5 Work Packages)

| WP | Title | Timeline | Key Output |
|----|-------|----------|------------|
| WP1 | Literature Review & Fieldwork | Months 1-12 | Validated theoretical model |
| WP2 | Experimental Design & Planning | Months 13-24 | Finalized experimental protocol |
| WP3 | Experimental Trials & Data Collection | Months 25-44 | Micro + macro datasets across 4 countries |
| WP4 | Data Analysis | Months 45-56 | Comprehensive findings + comparative insights |
| WP5 | Dissemination & Engagement | Months 1-60 | Open-access publications, policy briefs |

The TRANSACT research team consists of the PI, two PhD students, and two postdoctoral researchers.

## Citizen Science Approach

A distinctive feature is TRANSACT's **transdisciplinary approach**: co-producing field experiments with civil society organizations. Non-professional researchers (journalists, transparency advocates, students) participate as **citizen scientists** in designing trials and administering FOI requests. This generates authentic empirical data while building civic capacity.

## International Conference (March 27-28, 2025)

The international colloquium **"Transparency in Action -- International Perspectives from Experimental Research on Freedom of Information Laws"** was held at CEPAP, ULB, with **49 participants** from Europe and Africa.

**Day 1** featured:
- Research presentations by **Ben Worthy** (UK), **Julia Trautendorfer** (Germany), **Lorenzo Cicatiello** (Italy)
- Roundtable with transparency practitioners: **Martin Stoll** (LoiTransparence.ch, Switzerland), **Claude Archer** (Transparencia.be, Belgium), **Rachel Hanna** (Access Info Europe, Spain)
- Hands-on experimental design workshop for Switzerland and Romania

**Day 2** featured:
- Presentations on FOI in Africa: **John Sseruyange** (Makerere University, Uganda), **Hlengiwe Ndlovu** (University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa)
- Experimental design workshop for South Africa and Uganda

The conference was funded by **FNRS** (EUR 3,127), **ULB** (EUR 675), and **CIVIS network + University of Naples** (EUR 3,550), for a total budget of approximately **EUR 7,350**.

## Dissemination & Impact

TRANSACT's dissemination strategy has built an integrated international communication ecosystem:

- **Le Soir interview** (October 10, 2024): National media coverage of the Belgian experiment results
- **CivicSciTV Network video**: Explanatory video on YouTube presenting the experimental approach
- **MySociety webinar**: Partnered with the pioneer British civic tech organization, attracting new collaborators including Dr. Maria Zuffova (European University Institute)
- **IDUAI collaboration**: The Centre for Law and Democracy (CLD), supported by UNESCO, GFMD, and GIJN, included Belgium in the International Day for Universal Access to Information project
- **FOIAnet**: Results disseminated within the Freedom of Information Advocates Network
- **Conference panels**: Chaired "Transparency" panel at PMRC 2025 (Seoul) and co-chaired panel at ICPP7 (Chiang Mai)

### New Experiments Launched

- **Switzerland** (July-September 2025): In collaboration with LoiTransparence.ch
- **Romania** (from January 2026): Extending the network further
