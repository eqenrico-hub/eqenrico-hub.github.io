## Research Areas

### 1. New Public Management (NPM) and Railway Sector Reforms

Esposito's doctoral research and early career focused on the spread of NPM models across European public sectors, with particular application to the EU's governance of complex public infrastructure projects and the high-speed railway sector.

**Key publications:**
- Esposito, G., Ferlie, E., & Gaeta, G. L. (2018). "The European Public Sectors in the Age of Managerialism." *Politics*, 38(4), 480-499.
- Esposito, G., Cicatiello, L., & Ercolano, S. (2020). "Reforming Railways in the EU: An Empirical Assessment of Liberalisation Policies in the European Rail Freight Market." *Transportation Research Part A*, 132, 606-613.

### 2. Governance of Megaprojects (Lyon-Turin High-Speed Railway)

A major research stream examining how complex public projects are governed, with the Lyon-Turin high-speed railway as the primary case study. These studies highlight that success requires transparent collaboration among public, private, and civil society stakeholders, while failure often results from secrecy and poor communication.

**Key publications:**
- Esposito, G., Nelson, T., Ferlie, E., & Crutzen, N. (2021). "The institutional shaping of global megaprojects: The case of the Lyon-Turin high-speed railway." *International Journal of Project Management*, 39(6), 658-671.

### 3. Sustainable Urban Development and Smart Cities

Postdoctoral work on transparent, multi-stakeholder collaboration in urban governance. Research was conducted during postdoctoral positions at HEC Liege (Wal-e-Cities project, funded by the European Regional Development Fund) and the University of Antwerp (FASS-Food EU project on fair and sustainable food networks, with the World Fair Trade Organization-Europe).

**Key publications:**
- Esposito, G., Terlizzi, A., Desdemoustier, J., Pichault, F., & Crutzen, N. (2024). "Smart City Development as Public Entrepreneurship: An In-Depth Case Study of Mayoral Action Based on Actor-Network Theory." *International Journal of Public Administration*.
- Galego, D., Esposito, G., & Crutzen, N. (2024). "Sustainable Urban Development: A Scoping Review of Barriers to Public Policy and Administration." *Public Policy and Administration*.

### 4. Migration Policy

Research collaborations and capacity-building with international organizations including ICMPD (International Center for Migration Policy Development) and the European Commission's EuroMed Migration Program.

**Key activities:**
- IMAG project: Workshops on Whole of Government Approach to Migration Policies in Iraq (2023)
- MCP Med TI: Training expert for Jordanian migration practitioners (2023)
- EuroMed IV Migration Project: Coordinated research on labor matching policies in the Mediterranean (2018-2019), later adopted by the European Commission

### 5. Freedom of Information (FOI) Laws

The most recent and now primary research focus. Conducted the Belgian FOI field experiment, leading to the TRANSACT ERC Starting Grant proposal. This research stream grew from the observation that public projects fail due to lack of transparency -- citizens face barriers to accessing vital information.

**Key publications:**
- Esposito, G., Cicatiello, L., Mabillard, V., & Gaeta, G. L. (2024). "Toward a citizen science framework for public policy evaluation." *Evaluation*.
- Mabillard, V., Esposito, G., et al. (2024). "Barriers to Freedom of Information: Insights from an Experiment in Belgium." *International Journal of Public Administration*.
